I built a Chrome extension that lets you 𝗰𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝗮𝗻𝘆 𝘄𝗲𝗯𝗽𝗮𝗴𝗲.

No more endless scrolling.
No more Ctrl+F searching.
No more tab switching.

Just ask questions and get instant answers.

Here's what it does:

→ Extracts content from any page (even JavaScript-rendered)
→ Streams AI responses in real-time
→ Remembers your conversation context
→ Persists chat history until you close the tab

𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝘁𝗲𝗰𝗵 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗰𝗸:

• LangChain for prompt templates, chains & memory
• Google Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite (fastest model)
• Vite + CRXJS for Chrome extension bundling
• Chrome Storage API for persistence

𝘛𝘩𝘦 𝘣𝘦𝘴𝘵 𝘱𝘢𝘳𝘵?

It's completely 𝗼𝗽𝗲𝗻-𝘀𝗼𝘂𝗿𝗰𝗲.

You can clone it, customize it, or use it as a learning resource for building AI-powered browser extensions.
